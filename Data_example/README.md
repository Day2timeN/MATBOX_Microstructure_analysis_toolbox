# Data example
Several open-source segmented volumes are available directly from this repository.

## From the NREL Battery Microstructures open-source Library:
### In the folder "From computed tomography"
- nmc-1-cal-blackisporepluscbd.tif, a Nickel Manganese Cobalt oxide positive electrode (2-phase domain).
- graphite-5-cal-blackisporepluscbd, a graphite negative electrode (2-phase domain).

**More volumes are available from the above link, as well as gray level data set.**

## From the microstructure generation module of this toolbox:
### In the folder "From computed tomography with additives numerically generated"
- nmc-1-cal_generatedCBD_additivebridge.tif, nmc-1-cal-blackisporepluscbd.tif but with additive (Carbon-binder domain) numerically generated.

### In the folder "Numerically generated"
- Ellipsoids.tif, unisize ellipsoid-based particles domain with a preferential alignment.
- Bi_layer.tif, a bi-layer material with variation of particle size and porosity.
- Bi_layer_poreformer.tif, a bi-layer material with pore former in one layer.
- Two_particle_size.tif, tri-domain material: pore (background), small and large spherical particles.
