# Third-party open-source software
The toolbox uses third-party open-source software: *Taufactor*, from Dr. Samuel Cooper for tortuosity factor calculations and *Iso2mesh*, from Dr. Qianqian Fang for microstructure meshing, respectively used in the microstructure characterization and meshing modules.

In addition, the toolbox uses third-party algorithms: *xlscol* from Kevin Crosby, *DataHash* from Jan, and *Noiselevel* from Masayuki Tanaka, respectively used to help exporting data in excel files, compare microstructure states in iterative algorithms through their hash value, and estimate image noise level before and after image filtering.

*Taufactor*, *xlscol*, *DataHash*, and *Noiselevel* use BSD license and are included in the toolbox repository. \
*Iso2mesh* uses GPLv2 and is not included in the toolbox repository. User will have to download Iso2mesh manually. Installation steps are detailed in the documentation.
